	"The new tools of monetary policy": "Since the 1980s, interest rates around the world have trended downward, reflecting lower inflation, demographic and technological forces that have increased desired global saving relative to desired investment, and other factors. Although low inflation and interest rates have many benefits, the new environment poses challenges for central banks, who have traditionally relied on cuts to&hellip;",
	"Evaluating lower-for-longer policies: Temporary price-level targeting": "Despite a long and sustained recovery from the Great Recession, a number of factors\u2014including an aging population, slow productivity growth, and subdued inflation\u2014continue to exert downward pressure on U.S. interest rates. It seems likely that even when monetary policy is at a neutral setting, neither restraining nor stimulating the economy, interest rates will remain significantly&hellip;",
	"The housing bubble, the credit crunch, and the Great Recession: A reply to Paul Krugman": "Why was the Great Recession so deep? Certainly, the collapse of the housing bubble was the key precipitating event; falling house prices depressed consumer wealth and spending while leading to sharp reductions in residential construction. However, as I argue in a new paper and blog post, the most damaging aspect of the unwinding bubble was&hellip;",
	"Financial panic and credit disruptions in the 2007-09 crisis": "At the height of the financial crisis a decade ago, economists and policymakers underestimated the depth and severity of the recession that would follow. I argue in a paper released today by the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (BPEA) that remedying this failure demands a more thorough inclusion of credit-market factors in models and forecasts&hellip;",
	"Temporary price-level targeting: An alternative framework for monetary policy": "Low nominal interest rates, low inflation, and slow economic growth pose challenges to central bankers. In particular, with estimates of the long-run equilibrium level of the real interest rate quite low, the next recession may occur at a time when the Fed has little room to cut short-term rates. As I have written previously and&hellip;",

	"The zero lower bound on interest rates:  How should the Fed respond?": "In yesterday\u2019s post, I discussed recent research, by Michael Kiley and John Roberts of the Federal Reserve Board, on the problems for monetary policy that arise from the fact that short-term interest rates can\u2019t fall (much) below zero.\u00a0[1] Using econometric models to simulate the performance of the U.S. economy, Kiley and Roberts (KR) find that,&hellip;",
	"How big a problem is the zero lower bound on interest rates?": "If inflation is too low or unemployment too high, the Fed normally responds by pushing down short-term interest rates to boost spending. However, the scope for rate cuts is \u00a0limited by the fact that interest rates cannot fall (much) below zero, as people always have the option of holding cash, which pays zero interest, rather&hellip;",
	"Why Dodd-Frank\u2019s orderly liquidation authority should be preserved": "The collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008 was perhaps the defining event of the financial crisis.
